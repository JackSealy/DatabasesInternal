# DatabasesInternal
A database that with two tables: A table of players and a table of cards/pokemon. The pokemon have many stats while the only thing that the players table has to is keep track of their ID, first name, last name and age (optional).

It will then select what it needs to and print it off nicely using the tabulate library for python.
